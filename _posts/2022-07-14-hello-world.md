Since this is a technology related blog, its first post could not have different title than "Hello World". This post will be mostly focused on my motivation on creating this this blog.

In case you wanna know a little bit more about me, my work experiencies and my hobbies in a funny (at least I've tried to be) way, feel free to check out the "[About me](https://luigiluz.github.io/about/)" page.

## ~~13~~ Reasons why... I started this blog

The are a few reasons that made me start this blog. The first one, was that the first project that I've worked with in my software engineering internship was an open source project. There, I was able to learn about embedded software development and technical stuff, but the most important things that I've learned is that we are able to accomplish remarkable things if we work as a group. I wouldn't be where I am today if my colleagues weren't patient with me and explained stuff such as how to make good commits and how to write an understandable code. So, this blog is here to share a little bit of my work and projects experiences and hopefully help some people out there facing similar problems to solve them faster.

The second reason is that writing or sharing knowledge in any kind of way also helps to improve your knowledge, and I personally believe that a well written tutorial or post can save you a lot of time and this is what I'm gonna try to bring in the blog posts and projects.

## What am I going to write about?

Initially I intend to write about a few projects that I've already done, but as the time passes, I also intend to write posts about artificial intelligence, machine learning, embedded machine learning (I'm personally really excited about this topic) and cybersecurity as well.

In the near future, I'm thinking about writing short posts following the "Today I learned" or "This week I learned" motto, where I'm going to bring a new topic that I've learned or used in the work that are good to know and suitable in different kind of problems.

## That's all folks

That's it guys, I'm really excited about this blog and hope it helps you some way in your studies or work problems! See you in the next post!
